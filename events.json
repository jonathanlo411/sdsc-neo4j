You can also build the image outside the supercomputer cluster with your laptop, which will give you complete control over choosing any major Linux distributions and system libraries and can decide how to install the application you need. What is more important is, unlike other container platforms such as Docker, Singularity is dedicated to running on clusters! Therefore, once the Singularity image is created, you can quickly run it on supercomputer clusters, including TSCC and Expanse at SDSC. You do not have to worry about how to install all the software you need in each different cluster. <br><br>In this webinar, we will first show you how to build Singularity images on your local resource, such as your laptop. Then, we will introduce some commonly used repositories, e.g., Docker Hub, so you will learn where to pull other containers to create the Singularity images. For more complicated software requests, we will introduce the proper workflow to build a Singularity sandbox for test purposes and how to record them into a Singularity recipe so a final custom container can be created accordingly. Once a Singularity image is created, it can be uploaded and run on an SDSC cluster. We will show three ways to run the applications within the container. Based on the cluster file system structure, we will introduce the binding point technique from Singularity to locate the proper storage and how to add binding points into the recipe.

However, if this is your first time using an HPC system and interacting with a batch job scheduler like Slurm, writing your first batch job scripts and submitting them to the scheduler can be somewhat intimidating. Moreover, these batch job schedulers can be configured in many different ways and will often have unique features and options from system to system that you will need to consider when writing your batch jobs.</span></p>\n",
            "short": "Learn how to write your first batch job script and submit it to a Slurm batch job scheduler. We discuss best practices on how to structure your batch job scripts, teach you how to leverage Slurm environment variables, and provide you with some tips on how to request resources from the scheduler to get your work done faster.  We also introduce you to some advanced features like Slurm job arrays and job dependencies for more structured computational workflows."

With the Singularity image, you can share, move and reproduce the application you build in the container. You can also build the image outside of the supercomputer cluster, which means with your laptop, you will have full control to choose any major Linux distributions, system libraries, and can decide how to install the application you need. What is more important is, unlike other container platforms such as Docker, Singularity is dedicated to running on clusters! Therefore, once the Singularity image is created, you can easily run it on many of the supercomputer clusters including TSCC at SDSC. You don\u2019t have to worry about how to install all the software you need on each different cluster. <br><br> In this webinar, we will first show how to build Singularity images on your local resource such as your laptop. Some commonly used repositories will be introduced, e.g.: Docker Hub, so you will learn where to pull other containers to create the Singularity images. For more complicated software requests, we will introduce the proper workflow to build a Singularity sandbox for test purposes, and how to record them into a Singularity recipe so a final custom container can be created accordingly. <br><br>Once the Singularity image is created, it can be uploaded and run on a cluster like TSCC. We will show three ways to run the applications within the container. Based on the cluster file system structure, we will introduce the binding point technique from Singularity to locate the proper storage, and how to add binding points into the recipe. Also, we will let you know how to make a short command to replace the long Singularity run command. <br><br>Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of using HPC environment is assumed but not required.</p>",

Although the transition should be straightforward for most users, there are some important differences in both the hardware and software between these two systems. We will start with an overview of the <em>Expanse</em> architecture, which is based on AMD\u2019s 64-core EPYC Rome processor and NVIDIA\u2019s V100 GPU. Moving from Intel to AMD processors introduces a new set of compilers, math libraries and tools. We\u2019ll explain how to use the AMD software stack to build and run applications for optimal performance. GPU applications will port easily to <em>Expanse</em> and the upgrade from Comet\u2019s P100s to the newer V100s generally results in significantly reduced run times. With regard to job submission, we continue to use the Slurm resource manager. Partition names are left unchanged, but job scripts will have to be updated to reflect the larger core counts and, for highly scalable applications, maximum job size. We also introduce a new charging model that fairly takes into account the usage of all resources (memory, CPU, GPU). The tutorial concludes with a discussion of interactive computing using the <em>Expanse Portal</em> and efficiently moving data from <em>Comet</em> to <em>Expanse</em>.</p>\n",
